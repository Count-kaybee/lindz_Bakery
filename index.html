                <p>In 2018, I founded a small bakery business specializing in custom cakes, delicious muffins, and mouth-watering cookies. Business was steadily
                    growing, and we were gaining a loyal customer base. However, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we experienced a significant impact. The lockdown
                    restrictions and limitations on social gatherings resulted in a drastic decrease in orders for custom cakes, which were typically popular for events
                    such as birthdays, weddings, and parties. Foot traffic also dwindled, affecting the sales of muffins and cookies from our storefront. To adapt, we pivoted
                    to offering contactless delivery and pickup options, as well as promoting our products through social media and online platforms. Despite the challenges,
                    we managed to survive by adjusting our business model and focusing on online sales and delivery services.</p>
                <p>Even in the face of adversity, we remained committed to delivering high-quality, delectable treats to our customers. As things gradually return to normal,
                    we are excited to welcome both returning and new customers to experience the joy of our custom cakes, muffins, and cookies. Whether you're celebrating a
                    special occasion or simply craving a sweet indulgence, our baked goods are always available to brighten your day. We look forward to serving you and bringing
                    a little sweetness into your life.</p>
